Karma edition
.............

There are several ways to support the QField project, one of them is to buy the
`QField Karma edition app <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.opengis.qfieldkarmaedition>`_
in GooglePlay. This app will give help you to get a good karma and help us to continue to develop the
QField app. Please note that the QField Karma edition does not offer any additional features. In fact,
you will still need to install the normal QField app. Please also note that there are other preferred ways
to support the development of QField.
