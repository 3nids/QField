Custom SVG symbols and settings
==================================

In the about dialog you can see where the shared folders are on your device.

If you want to use custom symbols you need to put them there using a file manager.

*Warning* : some apps may block your access to svg folder. On Samsung devices, you have to deactivate Samsung "Secured Folder" app in order to access to the svg folder. Otherwise, this folder is hidden.
