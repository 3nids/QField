QField Project Management
=========================

Portable Project
----------------

You will need a portable version of your QGIS project file (.qgs). Portable
means that all paths are relative and datasets are reachable from the device.

Check that :menuselection:`Project --> Project Properties --> General --> Save paths` 
is set to "Relative" and that all required data files are in the same folder like the .qgs file or a subfolder of it.

For increased productivity, we suggest having a look at the `QFieldSync plugin <https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qfieldsync>`_.

Coordinate Reference Systems
----------------------------

QField uses the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) information found in the project file.

* Project CRS
* On the fly reprojection (OTF) is used for visualization
* Layer CRS

Vector Layer Settings
---------------------

Most of the settings which QGIS offers are directly supported by QField without any extra effort.

Style
.....

All style settings from QGIS are directly supported by QField. This includes all renderer types like graduated, categorized, rule based, 2.5D as well as data defined symbology.

Display Expression
==================

In QField, objects are identified with a name. The expression to generate this name can be defined
by opening the attribute table in QGIS and switching to the form view. Choose the appropriate
field or an expression in the list there. Starting from QGIS 3, this can be done directly from
the :menuselection:`Vector Layer Properties --> Display` page.

.. container:: clearer text-center

  .. image:: /images/define_display_expression.png
     :width: 500px
     :alt: Define display expression

Forms and Fields
----------------

QField creates forms similar to, but not equal to QGIS.

Suppress Feature Form
  The setting suppress feature form is directly applied to the QField form.

Remember last values
  QField offers a much more fine-grained control over the last used values and ignores the QGIS setting.

Field settings
  The field settings from QGIS are supported on a beste effort basis and is constantly being improved.

Drag and drop designer forms
  Groups and Tabs from Drag and Drop designer forms are supported.

Conditional visibility
  Groups can be hidden based on an expression. This is useful when certain attributes are
  only required under certain conditions. As an example imagine mapping trees. Some of them
  might have a disease and you have a list of possible deseases. To not clutter the form with
  many fields, make a group and configure a visibility expression for a group "diseases". Add
  a field "desease" with a checkbox. Only when the checkbox is checked, the list of diseases
  will be available to the user.

Constraints
  Attribute fields can have constraints attached. Constraints are expressions that needs to
  evaluate to :code:`True` (or :code:`1`) in order to be able to save the form. Constraints
  are configured on a per-field basis and a description can be added that will be shown to the
  user if a constraint is not satisfied.

  Common use cases are:

  - :code:`"elevation" < 5000`: `You cannot enter an elevation value higher than the highest mountain in this country.`
  - :code:`"identifier" IS NOT NULL`: `It is required to fill in an identifier.`

Default values
  Fields can have default values configured. Default values are inserted into the
  attribute form when digitizing a new feature. They are visible to the user and can
  be modified as long as the field is editable. They can be based on the geometry or
  expression variables.

  Common use cases are:

  - :code:`now()`: Insert the current date and time
  - :code:`length($geometry)`: Insert the length of the digitized line
  - :code:`@operator_name`: Configure global variables on the device and insert them.

Editable
  The editable flag of fields is respected.

Custom SVG symbols and settings
===============================

In the about dialog you can see where the shared folders are on your device.

If you want to use custom symbols you need to put them there using a file manager.

External SD card
================

In order to have write access to projects which are on an external SD card, you will have to put it into the following folder:

.. code-block:: none

    /Android/data/ch.opengis.qfield/files
