 * QgsCredentials (because it's stored before), they are used for the login. If not, QGIS would popup a
 * Login Dialog, but QField does not. The realms (where it should log in to) are just added to the list
 * of unhandled realms. When all layers are handled, the login dialog is diplayed for each of them. On
 * successful login, the credentials are stored in QgsCredentials and removed from the list. When the list
 * is empty (or contains only canceled realms), the project is reloaded. This time the logins are contained
 * in QgsCredentials and no dialog needs to pop up.
